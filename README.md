# hello-world
==============

Hello everyone,

I am brand new to scripting, coding, programming, you name it. My family has all been very involved in computers and various subcategories related to computers for as long as I can remember. I have always been very curious and quick to learn anything computer related and always very interested in anything and everything I could find to tinker with. However, I have also been completely self taught (what does this button do?) until now. I am diving in head-first to learn whatever I can get my hands on now while trying to decide if a career in IT may be a path I would excel in and truly enjoy doing every day.
